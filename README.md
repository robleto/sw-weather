Hello there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for visiting.

Long ago in the early Internet I recall seeing a site that was sharing the weather as a comparison to different Star Wars planets. I think they've introduced about 100 new planets since that original app went dark.  So, I decided to use this project to sharpen my skills in digital illustration using Figma, Illustrator and Photoshop as well as to explore building (with a fair amount of consultation wtih the Generative AI at OpenAI) a robust React Next.js site that includes API integration and search queries.
